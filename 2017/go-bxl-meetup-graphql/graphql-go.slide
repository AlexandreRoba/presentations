* About me
- Using Go for a year(and love it)
- CTO at Lab Box (D'Ieteren Mobility)

- This is my first Meetup

* Agenda
- Setup your environment (On Mac...)
- Dependencies management
- Graphql project with dependency management

* SetUp: Install Go
- Downlad it from https://golang.org/dl/ 
- Install it with homebrew
  brew install go

* Setup GO environment Variable
- $GOROOT
Define the path to your GO installation folder
The install should have created a symlink in /usr/local/bin

* Setup Workspace environment Variable
- $GOPATH
Define the path to a Workspace folder
A workspace include of the following folders
  */src/<host>/<owner>/repo* 
  */bin/* 
  */pkg/* 

* Setup Workspace environment Variable 
- $GOPATH
It can be a colon separated list of path:
GO get will install packages in the first folder
GO compiler will resolve in both folder

- Libraries: /Users/aroba/golib
This is where you put the common libs/tools

- Projects: /Users/aroba/gocode
This is where you store *your code*
_Open source project should be cloned on the libraries folder_
